# @Compound-Community/merkle-distributor (forked from @dharma-eng/merkle-distributor)


These contracts have been modified to include a mechanism for "funding" the distributor from a specific funder and with a specific amount of the target token, designated at the time of deployment. The funder must first approve the distributor to transfer the tokens to be funded on its behalf.

In order to generate a list of COMP to distribute to each address, run `node generateAddressBalances/generateAddressBalances.js`. You must first set a web3 wss url to the `WSS_URL` environment variable (`export WSS_URL='wss...'`).

Once the address balances are attained, the merkle tree can be generated by running `ts-node scripts/generate-merkle-root.ts --input generateAddressBalances/addressBalances.json`.
